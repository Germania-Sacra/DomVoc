    "4. **Do not translate**:\n",
    "   - Proper names of locations (e.g., *Aura an der Saale*), unless an established English version exists.\n",
    "   - Street names (e.g., *Brotstraße*).\n",
    "5. **Grammar:** Insert 'of' in front of proper names if this is grammatically correct. \n",
    "6. **Dates:** Copy dates exactly without modification.\n",
    "7. **Other terms:** Translate as you normally would, while maintaining the style and tone suitable for historical/religious texts.\n",
    "8. **Building Complex labels and descriptions:** Always start your translations of the label and description of the building complex with 'Building complex' \n",

    "    - should you not wish to leave the code cell running overnight, but have a large amount of rows to translate, you can also create slices of the dataframe (e.g. slice the dataframe into four) and translate these one after another with the line below. You can then later easily paste the outputs together into one file.\n",
